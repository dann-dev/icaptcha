= Introduction =

Brief description on how I have implemented internalization in this project, how can end user extend and provide their own language files.


= Language file definitions.=

Each language pack consits of *two* files

  * .dic
  * .aff

===Example set===
languagefile.dic languagefile.aff

The *.aff* file contains one line indicating the encoding used itn the *.dic* file,
if *.aff* file is not present default enconding will be assumed _ISO8859-1_
Format for the *.dic* files is simple one word per line
===Example set===
{{{
wordA
wordB
wordC
}}}

Original files were downloaded from Mozilla website, then stipped down from extra information and addapted to this project.
